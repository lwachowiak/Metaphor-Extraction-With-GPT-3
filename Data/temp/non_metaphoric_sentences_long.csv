54,Explaining crime : theories of criminality
55,"Suppose , for example , that it could be proved that one cause of delinquency was lack of parental supervision ."
56,It might still be necessary to ask why delinquency occurred with one son or daughter but not another .
57,"Also , there would be the further question of why the parents had not provided adequate supervision ."
58,Biological and psychological theories
59,To use his own language :
60,They have been widely criticised and rejected by sociologists .

76,‘ A little .
77,But please do not delay too long .
78,‘ I 'm sure .
79,Time to think ?
80,She did n't need a single second .
81,She had booked herself a bed at a YWCA hostel for the time being .
82,But for now it would have to do .
83,"Not everything that Paula had to do was quite so glamorous , however ."
84,Although she enjoyed her job Paula was lonely .
85,"She took her tray to the pay desk , opened her bag and felt for her purse ."
86,It was not there .
87,‘ I 'm sorry .
88,I seem to have lost my purse … ’ she explained .

90,Paula was going hot and cold by now .
91,Had it been stolen ?
92,"No , she remembered her bag tipping over in the cloakroom at Mattli — it must have fallen out then ."

107,He shrugged his narrow shoulders .
108,But I wanted to work for myself .
109,‘ What a small world !
110,‘ I will .
111,Though I do n't suppose I could afford to pay you as well as Mattli does — yet .
112,Maybe one day … ’
113,‘ And I 'm sure one day you 'll find him .
114,‘ Me too .
115,"‘ Thanks for the lunch , Gary ."
116,‘ I 'll need it .

123,‘ He 's not a rival … ’

125,‘ But I would never mention anything I have seen here ! ’

127,Even if you do not intend to be disloyal there is always the risk that you might be careless .
128,Pillow talk is the most dangerous . ’

132,‘ I ca n't promise not to see Gary again . ’
133,‘ Very well . ’
134,Please do not bother to come in again .
135,But she was determined Madame should not be aware of either .
136,"‘ Yes , Madame ."
137,His mouth was full of pins .
138,Then he unpinned the length of chiffon and let it fall to the floor .
139,"Why was it all women hated her so , even when they did n't know her ?"
140,"Gary got up , took Paula by the arm and led her over to the low sofa ."
141,‘ I have . ’
142,‘ Oh Lord !
143,You mean she thinks you 've been spying for me !
144,‘ But Gary — I have n't been spying for you !
145,I have n't even mentioned a single detail of the Mattli collection . ’
146,But if she can prove that you and I … ’
147,We have n't done anything wrong . ’
148,Every detail . ’
149,Oh Jesus Christ ! — suppose there 's something major ?
150,‘ For goodness sake stop panicking ! ’
151,Paula said when they were alone again .
152,Gary looked crestfallen .
153,‘ She 's the best I could get … ’
154,Paula said roundly .
155,‘ What do you mean ? ’
156,He looked like a worried small boy .
157,I 'll come and work for you . ’
158,‘ Oh Paula ! ’
159,"Well , not for ages , anyway ."
160,"But it was just as exciting , nevertheless ."
161,We hardly saw the Crowninshield twins .
162,‘ What do you think of her ? ’
163,‘ Is he ? ’
164,"‘ Yes , Nicholas , he is ."
165,But he 's not cute . ’

168,Rickie lit a cigarette .
169,‘ I just guess I 'm not hungry . ’
170,Robin-Anne reached over and tipped her brother 's food on to her own plate .
171,"‘ Bourbon , ’ he explained laconically ."
172,‘ Want some ? ’
173,‘ I thought you 'd never ask . ’
174,"‘ Cheers , ’ I said ."

178,"‘ We 'll have a bit more sea , kick up some spray . ’"
179,"Chatterton poured himself more bourbon , then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf ."
180,At first they 'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep .
181,‘ For all of us ? ’
182,"‘ It wo n't be easy , ‘ he said grimly , and I was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn Chatterton aboard ."
183,"‘ I noticed that Rickie was n't eating today , ’ I said , ‘ but Robin-Anne was ? ’"
184,"The big man thought for a few seconds , then laughed ."
185,‘ Can we be sure Robin-Anne did n't bring any of the drug aboard ? ’
186,"She studies the drug , you know ?"
187,"‘ So what are the twins , chances ? ’"
188,"‘ Why did you leave the army , Mr Chatterton ? ’"
189,"‘ I guess you can guess , ’ he said ."
190,want to be helped . ’
191,‘ Eventually . ’
192,"But once I 'd done it , I swore I 'd help others do it . ’"

207,‘ We are trying to establish the Truth of History'
208,"He asserts it often enough : ‘ History continually effects totalisations of totalisations , ( I , 15 ) ."

213,The Philosopher 's Child
214,WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AND GIRL CHILDREN
215,Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience ?
216,What is it to be treated as a child ?
217,NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18 … .
218,"( Aristotle , 1959,1260A )"
219,"( Hobbes , 1914 , p. 21 )"
220,Children … love to be treated as Rational Creatures sooner than is imagined … by which …
221,"( Locke , 1968 , p. 181 )"
222,"( Kant , 1930 , pp. 250–1 )"
223,"( Mill , 1910 , p. 139 )"
224,What are the philosophers ' children like ?
225,Locke 's remarks are just as puzzling .
226,Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were .
227,Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice ?
228,Mill 's minors are a little more complicated .
229,Hobbes et al .

232,What if no one wants him ?
233,What happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her ?
234,Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead ?

236,There are other difficulties too .
237,"( Holt , 1974 , p. 16 )"
238,What did he mean ?
239,"He adjusts the flaps , zips up his jacket , pulls down his goggles ."
240,"The runway is simply a strip of grass , cleared of rocks ."

245,"She has in front of her a typewriter , her recorder and her notes ."
246,A servant is preparing lunch on a fire .
247,Claudia hears something .
248,Claudia stands up .
249,With her lower lip she tucks the upper lip into her mouth for a moment .
250,She is wearing a long fitted skirt of khaki .
251,"She adjusts her hat , a round bush hat , and walks towards the makeshift landing strip ."
252,"The plane is taxiing , pursued by a group of running Masai warriors , glorious in their red and purple robes , ochred hair , lion head-dresses and so on ."
253,Claudia walks over towards the plane .
254,She holds her hat on her head with one hand .
255,"The plane is still now , surrounded by the warriors ."
256,Fairfax is securing its wheels with rocks .
257,He looks up to see her approaching .
258,Behind her is Ol Doinyo Lengai .
259,The Masai begin to sing .
260,"It is a strange , other-worldly noise ."
261,Claudia and Fairfax approach each other .
262,"The moment is unnaturally , poignantly , delayed ."
263,"In his uniform , jacket unzipped , he is handsome and smiling ."
264,The singing of the Masai and the overwhelming landscape are thrilling .
265,Claudia and Fairfax come closer .
266,She is serene .
267,"She kisses him , three times ."
268,‘ I am so glad you came . ’
269,‘ Anything to help a friend . ’
270,Fairfax is awkward .
271,‘ Your face is dirty .
272,He wipes his face with his sleeve .
273,‘ Sorry . ’
274,‘ I have prepared the lunch . ’
275,She touches his arm lightly .
276,They start to walk the short distance to her camp .
277,The throng of Masai surrounds them .
278,Her servant brings a bowl of hot water for Fairfax .
279,He washes his face .
280,Fairfax and Claudia sit down on camp chairs .
281,"The Masai stand a short distance off , curious , but self-absorbed ."
282,‘ What would you like to drink ? ’
283,‘ I think so . ’
284,"‘ Now , do you want to tell me all the facts ? ’"
285,"But the district officer , Miles Turnbull , would not accept it … ’"
286,"Her face , as she removes her hat and begins to speak , is startlingly beautiful , although not conventionally ."
287,Fairfax watches her .
288,"As she talks the servant brings the drinks and then the lunch , a grilled fowl with some preserves ."
289,As she speaks we see a Masai market .
290,"Some of the women are in robes of blue , others are in brown , dyed skins ."
291,The older men have blankets loosely slung over their shoulders .
292,"There is , incongruously , an open car to one side of the market ."
293,"From it , into the colourful throng , appears a young British district officer , Miles Turnbull ."
294,"He is carrying some papers and is accompanied by two askaris with rifles , and an interpreter , dressed in khakis ."
295,"The askaris wear military sweaters , Sam Brownes , shorts and socks ."
296,On their heads they wear fezes .
297,But he was overworked .
298,"I liked him , even though he was a little bit boring ."
299,He was so English .
300,‘ Very well .
301,‘ Very well .
302,His face is painted and he is carrying a spear .
303,On his head he wears a head-dress of lion mane .
304,He can not wait for the proposed exchange of animals .
305,But he tries to be reasonable .
306,‘ Tomorrow it will be ready .
307,I will bring it . ’
308,‘ It will be too late .
309,"The Masai warrior , Tepilit , is excited ."
310,A number of other Masai gather round .
311,"It is a beautiful animal , with huge , curved horns ."
312,‘ I will bring you two cattle tomorrow .
313,I will go now and deliver them myself to Narok . ’
314,Turnbull busies himself with his clipboard as his reply is translated .
315,It is a heavy weapon .
316,The askaris panic .
317,Tepilit drives his bull away .
318,He has in one hand a stick and is followed by a thin dog .
319,"From a distance we see Tepilit , walking steadily towards Ol Doinyo Lengai with his animals ."
320,They are tiny figures in a huge landscape .
321,"Fairfax has finished eating , but Claudia 's food is untouched ."
322,‘ The next day he presented himself for arrest . ’
323,‘ I knew his family well . ’
324,‘ Did you see him after the killing ? ’
325,‘ He came to my house and told me what had happened . ’
326,‘ And you told him to give himself up ? ’
327,‘ Of course .
328,What else should I do ? ’
329,‘ I 'm just asking .
330,If I can do anything I must know the facts . ’
331,Now I must help him . ’
332,‘ When is the trial ? ’
333,‘ It 's not arranged yet .
334,‘ A balls-up ?
335,It was worse than a balls-up .
336,It was a disaster .
337,His brother was killed .
338,All for a film .
339,‘ He was the producer ? ’
340,‘ He was an exploiter .
341,"He wanted blood , any blood ."
342,"Lions , Masai , all equal . ’"
343,‘ Why do you think he did it ?
344,"The moran , I mean ? ’"
345,‘ I do n't know . ’
346,There is a pause .
347,Claudia summons her servant who brings a coffee pot .
348,‘ I 'll go and see him tomorrow .
349,The jail at Ngiro Narok .
350,In front of the building is a row of white-painted stones and some cactus-like sisal plants forming a circle around a patch of grass .
351,In the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the Union Jack hangs .
352,A car pulls up outside .
353,An askari salutes as Fairfax steps out of the car in uniform .
354,He enters the building .
355,A young white policeman appears from his office reluctantly .
356,He straightens up and salutes Fairfax .
357,"‘ Sorry , Major ."
358,"I 'm Sergeant Jeavons , sir . ’"
359,‘ Major Fairfax .
360,I have the papers . ’
361,He does not appear to be disheartened .
362,‘ Stand up man .
363,"‘ I hope you are well , Tepilit ole Saibol . ’"
364,You may leave me here . ’
365,Fairfax shakes hands with Tepilit and sits on small stool .
366,Tepilit squats on the floor .
367,‘ How are you ? ’
368,‘ What age group are you ? ’
369,‘ Botorok . ’
370,‘ Is your father the laibon ? ’
371,‘ You have killed a lion . ’
372,I am praised because I held it by the tail . ’
373,‘ Does your father have many cattle ? ’
374,‘ We are owners of many cattle . ’
375,‘ I am happy .
376,Do you know me ? ’
377,‘ I am a friend of Claudia .
378,I am a soldier .
379,‘ Our people also fought the Germans . ’
380,‘ Your people fought very bravely . ’
381,‘ The Masai are brave . ’
382,‘ What do you want to discuss ? ’
383,‘ I am here because I was asked to come by Claudia .
384,‘ There is no need .
385,I have told her everything that happened . ’
386,‘ She is unhappy .
387,She does not want you to be tried by the government . ’
388,‘ We are betrothed .
389,‘ You are going to be married ? ’
390,‘ She must first ask her father who lives far away . ’
391,When you killed the district officer it was an accident . ’
392,I will tell the government .
393,"You thought the Nandi , the fat belly , wanted the askaris to shoot you . ’"
394,I did not .
395,The white man told the askaris to take my animal after I had offered to exchange it .
396,‘ They do n't like cattle . ’
397,‘ Some like cattle .
398,I have many cattle on my farm . ’
399,‘ Are they milk cattle living in a house as I have heard ? ’
400,‘ Not all .
401,Many are Masai cattle .
402,Only you can help me .
403,"The Nandi man has run away , frightened ."
404,You threw the spear wildly .
405,Unfortunately the district officer stepped forward .
406,‘ Many of my people saw me .
407,I can do no more . ’
408,Fairfax stands up .
409,I will come back . ’
410,‘ Please God . ’
411,Tepilit does not stand up .
412,He seems content .
413,The sergeant meets Fairfax outside the cell .
414,"‘ All right , sir ? ’"
415,‘ Not really .
416,"‘ Yes , sir ."
417,No excuses . ’
418,‘ Can I read his statement ? ’
419,‘ You have n't got a copy here ? ’
420,"‘ We have n't had any carbon paper for two years , sir . ’"
421,"‘ Yes , sir ."
422,"By me , sir . ’"
423,‘ Do you speak Masai ? ’
424,"‘ No , sir , but we got the Larusa translator in ."
425,"He 's the official police translator , sir ."
426,In the cell Tepilit sits motionless on the floor .
427,At Claudia 's camp it is almost evening .
428,Fairfax steps out of the car .
429,Claudia comes to greet him and kisses him lightly on both cheeks .
430,‘ How was he ? ’
431,‘ Stubborn . ’
432,‘ He would not agree ? ’
433,‘ No . ‘
434,‘ Would you like something to drink ? ’
435,They are approaching the fire .
436,‘ Did you accept any gifts ? ’
437,‘ He was very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace .
438,‘ What a balls-up .
439,I have flown my plane with cadged army fuel six hundred miles .
440,I am supposed to be at GHQ .
441,"‘ Please , Tom . ’"
442,She touches his arm .
443,"‘ Please , Tom ."
444,It is completely crazy .
445,"There 's a war , the Germans are trying to kill every Jew in the world and you are going to hang one Masai because of a misunderstanding . ’"
446,"‘ There 's no misunderstanding , unfortunately ."
447,He seems determined to die . ’
448,‘ Determined to die .
449,‘ I will try .
450,I will also get the translation of his evidence .
451,A boma near Ol Doinyo Lengai .
452,Fairfax and Claudia are meeting the Masai .
453,Around them graceful Masai women in long leather skirts are sweeping the boma and plastering the huts with cow dung .
454,He is wearing a blue tunic and around his shoulders is a fur cloak made of the skins of the hyrax .
455,"In his hands he holds a snuff box , shaped like a small quiver , and a thin stick ."
456,"Two warriors , one of whom is Saibol , Tepilit 's younger brother , stand at a distance ."
457,Sentue is speaking .
458,They want to take our cows to pay for the war .
459,We give them our cows .
460,Our cows are our life .
461,I am a rich man .
462,I have many cows and many children .
463,You can not kill a man deliberately . ’
464,You must kill him . ’
465,"‘ A white man has blood , red blood also . ’"
466,‘ The white man has blood .
467,Claudia speaks : ‘ Your son must say it was an accident .
468,Claudia is upset .
469,Fairfax shouts : ‘ You are a stupid man .
470,Why does he want to marry a white woman ?

1775,"Another was the increased availability of , and demand for , cocaine ."
1776,‘ You and I would die of frostbite .
1777,"Same building — just a matter of money and management ’ ( Parkin , 1989 ) ."
1778,"Nevertheless , the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities , and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship — combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry , harassment , and tension — make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach ."
1779,I repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week 's riots was the conduct of the police .

1781,"( Dear , 1985 , p. 69 )"
1782,"In Chapter 10 Gatrell and Vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards , risk assessment , hazardous waste disposal , emergency planning , natural hazards and environmental epidemiology ."
1783,"The substantive content of much of this research straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences ."
1784,"To model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area , for example , an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution would be required ."
1785,In applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and GIS in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field .
1786,"The discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters , particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets ."
1787,"Like most of the other contributors to this section , Gatrell and Vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field ."
1788,"Given that ‘ most GIS are rather dumb systems , requiring intelligent , very computer literate users ’ , managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency ."
1789,The settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests .
1790,These include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers .
1791,"According to Shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount , capacity and condition of urban land , transport networks , utilities , hospitals , schools and other major communal facilities ."
1792,"In addition to these data requirements , such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making ."
1793,"Shepherd , more than any other contributor to this section , draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms , the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision , data ownership and the control of access to data ."
1794,Digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision .
1795,In Chapter 12 Brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of US census tract data from 1950 onwards .
1796,"He describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the UK and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location , market research , credit rating and target marketing ."
1797,Brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live .
1798,"In the last part of this contribution , Brown identifies a number of priorities for future research ."
1799,"Like Gatrell and Vincent and Shepherd before him , he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses ."
1800,Spatial linkages also feature prominently in Brown 's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from Openshaw in Chapter 3 .
1801,The analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors .
1802,Other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice .
1803,This is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature .
1804,"In summary , then , as fig. 8.1 shows , many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments ."
1805,Spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics .
1806,Questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications .
1807,Spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields .
1808,The evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields .
1809,"Finally , in all applications fields , the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds ."
1810,This is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities .
1811,Such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers .
1812,The final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information .
1813,Campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of GIS .
1814,This contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice .
1815,"All too often , as the experience of many mature applications indicates , technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities ."
1816,Campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of GIS diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines .
1817,The findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields .
1818,In this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by Openshaw at the beginning of Part Two .
1819,Environmental monitoring and prediction
1820,"Monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind ( Tickell 1986 , 1989 ) ."
1821,"This awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion , on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming , on nitrate pollution , on deforestation in the Tropics , on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics ."
1822,Usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming Armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation .
1823,Thus the algal bloom off the Italian Adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds .
1824,"More globally , the Brundtland Report ( WCED 1987 ) noted that , in the 900 days during which the World Commission was at work ,"
1825,The African drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them ;
1826,The Bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more ;
1827,The Chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across Europe ;
1828,A chemical fire in Switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the Rhine at least as far as the Netherlands ;
1829,At least 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water .
1830,"As a consequence of these and other disasters , of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals , the environment is now ‘ moving fast up the political agenda ’ ( Patten 1989 ) ."
1831,"The then Prime Minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment in statements such as : ‘ it is possible that with all these enormous changes ( population , agricultural , use of fossil fuels ) concentrated into such a short period of time , we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself ’ ( Thatcher 1988 ) ."
1832,The political concern is not altruistic .
1833,"Mrs Thatcher , a recent convert to environmental conservation , clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective :"
1834,"In the past when we identified forms of pollution , we have shown our capacity to act effectively ."
1835,The great London smogs are now only a nightmare of the past .
1836,We have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent .
1837,"We are spending £4 billion on cleansing the Mersey Basin alone , and the Thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world ."
1838,"Even though this kind of action may cost a lot , I believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other … ."
1839,The Government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development .
1840,Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded ( Thatcher 1988 ) .
1841,The primary official manifestation of this UK commitment to the environment has been the government 's White Paper ( HMSO 1990 ) .
1842,"While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few ‘ teeth ’ and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments ( notably those of Agriculture and of Transport ) , it was none the less a major achievement ."
1843,"Its main sections dealt with the government 's approach to the environment ( nationally , at the European level and globally ) , the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect , environmental problems in both rural and urban areas ( especially in relation to land-use matters ) , pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters ."
1844,Central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence .
1845,There is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment .
1846,"Though there has been a change of Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for the Environment since the publication of the White Paper , the environmental cause seems as strong as ever ."
1847,"Thus , The Times of 17 December 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior Civil Servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ‘ ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change ’ ."
1848,"Pearce et al. ( 1989 ) have argued that the effects of government , commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the UK government will proceed ."
1849,"Given such a lead , it is scarcely surprising that British scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes ; Table 9.1 , for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the UK domestic economy ."
1850,"If it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary , indeed is even vital , the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important : the 170 000 people in the Maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sea-level !"
1851,"Yet , as we shall see below , the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that , in many cases , we simply do not yet have ."
1852,"Even monitoring of the present is very imperfect , as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates ."
1853,"This chapter , then , attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction , describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next ."
1854,The nature of environmental processes
1855,"Notwithstanding Mrs Thatcher 's confidence that we can ‘ fix ’ environmental problems , the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable ."
1856,"Some of the reasons for this — the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks , taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes , processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and ( often ) multinational researchers involved — are discussed briefly later ."
1857,"Even at this stage , however , it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many processes in the natural environment ."
1858,The next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know ; it is derived chiefly from the Earth System Sciences Committee ( ESSC ) ( 1988 ) .
1859,Temporal and spatial scales of operation
1860,"Even ignoring the effects of man , earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales ( see Fig. 9.1 ; see also Rosswall et al. 1988 ) ."
1861,"Thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations ( such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of Los Angeles ) , are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle ."
1862,"In contrast , soil creation ( cf. soil degradation ) may require hundreds or thousands of years ."
1863,In between are variations in phenomena such as El Nino .
1864,The sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement .
1865,"In this chapter , the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km ."
1866,"It is , however , impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods : a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades ."
1867,"Conversely , a large-scale and long-period phenomenon such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects ."
1868,This therefore has the following consequences :
1869,We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends ;
1870,"Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings , we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge ( such as via tree rings , palynology , oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change ) ;"
1871,"Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems , collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise ;"
1872,We must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced ;
1873,"Irrespective of the use of surrogates , monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards ( hence the IGBP ( see below ) is designed to run for two or three decades ) ;"
1874,Changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available .
1875,Much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis .
1876,This is not merely because of its topical nature .
1877,The main reason is that — though some problems are local and are best studied that way — many others ( even involving a limited geographical extent ) are best understood within a global framework .
1878,Thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world .
1879,"Moreover , recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the North Atlantic ( every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather ) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical Pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the Drake Passage and up into the Atlantic ."
1880,"Thus , to understand some local and many regional , national and continental and all global environmental events , we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases ( Rhind and Mounsey 1989 ; Mounsey and Tomlinson 1988 ) ."
1881,"In no way , however , does this invalidate the need for microscale studies — for instance , while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them , only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring ."
1882,"A major complication , however , is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment ."
1883,"Given this , determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty ."
1884,"Figure 9.2 is taken from ESSC ( 1988 ) and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes , as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment ."
1885,"In essence , the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one , these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities ."
1886,The main components of the first system are well known : the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions .
1887,"We are , however , becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate ; research into ocean/atmosphere interactions is now a priority ."
1888,"In ocean dynamics studies , important topics are heat storage , circulation and the role of sea ice ."
1889,"Atmospheric circulation ( and , in turn , precipitation and temperature ) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface , itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics ."
1890,"The biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life — carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and others — through what has been described as the total earth system ."
1891,The oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles ; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget .
1892,"Trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulphur and the halogens ; as is now well known , their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide , ozone , methane , nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes ( CFMs ) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system ."
1893,"A particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main CFMs is increasing by about 5 per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane , nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1 , 0.4 and 0.3 per cent ."
1894,"Finally , the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone ."
1895,There are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability ( except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost ) .
1896,"If , for instance , the concentrations of certain trace gases ( see above ) continue to increase , it has been predicted that the earth 's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation ( about 18 000 years BP ) — though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change ."
1897,"The converse case — the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes — is also of obvious importance : changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation , together with the probabilities of extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts , are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type , at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity ."
1898,Human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology .
1899,"fossil fuel combustion , for instance , has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation ( ’ acid rain' ) and many rivers , lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural , urban or industrial sources ."
1900,"It should be stressed , however , that — while the outlines of human activities are clear — there are still many uncertainties : for instance , we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959 ."
1901,"But calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that , if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere , the concentration would have increased by twice as much ."
1902,"The absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors : absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota , the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the Industrial Revolution ."
1903,Does God play dice ?
1904,Much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or Newtonian deterministic basis .
1905,"The environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered , described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known ."
1906,"An argument by many atmospheric physicists , for example , is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models , the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power ( see Fig. 9.3 , derived from Tyler 1989 ) ."
1907,"In contrast , the advocates of chaos theory ( e.g. Stewart 1989 ) argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even ‘ the faint beat of a butterfly 's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane ’ ."
1908,"In essence , they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework ."
1909,"If so , there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems ."
1910,"This has been recognized by , among others , ESSC ( 1988 ) ."
1911,The authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2–3 weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics ; such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic .
1912,"To complicate matters still further , however , it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components ."
1913,"As an example , atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability , a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations , a weak minimum variability for 10–20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales ( ESSC 1988 ) ."
1914,It need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise .
1915,"Finally , it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed ."
1916,"In general , the research work of the international groups of scientists , including those involved in the Inter-Governmental Committee and in the UK 's Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change , has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of , for example , global warming ."
1917,"In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution , Sir John Mason ( a former Director of the Meteorological Office ) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises ; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans , etc. , lower values of predicted changes are likely ."
1918,"Thus , while almost all scientists are — at the time of writing — convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average , the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only 5 years ago ."
1919,Who is involved and what is going on ?
1920,"If we consider the environment in the broadest sense , much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the UK ; these include the DoE , the Forestry Commission , the Nature Conservancy , the Health and Safety Executive , local authorities , the component members of the Natural Environment Research Council ( such as the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the British Antarctic Survey ) , individuals or research groups in academia , the CEGB , the Friends of the Earth , and UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development ( CEED ) ( 1989 ) ."
1921,"The diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries ; numerous multinational organizations , both quasi-governmental ( e.g. the UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) ) and non-governmental ( e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) and the International Institute for Environment and Development ( IIED ) ) are also active in the field ."
1922,"Moreover , commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine , notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures ."
1923,The international scientific involvement
1924,Scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment .
1925,"Thus , at the global scale , the International Council of Scientific Unions ( ICSU ) has endorsed the setting up of the International Geosphere Biosphere Project ( IGBP ) to ‘ describe and understand the interactive physical , chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system , the unique environment it provides for life , the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions ’ ( Report of ad hoc Planning Group for IGBP 1986 , quoted in IGBP 1988 ) ."
1926,"Priority in the IGBP is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries , that most affect the biosphere , that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical , predictive capability for global change ."
1927,This is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes :
1928,Documenting and predicting global change ;
1929,Observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions ;
1930,Improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total Earth system ;
1931,Assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources .
1932,"By 1990 , IGBP had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects ( IGBP 1990 ) addressing these four themes ."
1933,"In addition , plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for IGBP ( known as IGBP-DIS ) had been announced ."
1934,The latter are particularly relevant to this chapter .
1935,"Based in Paris and working under Professor I. Rasool , it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first 2 years ( 1990–92 ) but then to expand considerably thereafter ."
1936,"Tasks agreed for the IGBP-DIS include making available a ‘ directory of data directories ’ modelled on NASA 's Master Directory , providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study ."
1937,"Until 1990 , remarkably little interaction had taken place between the ‘ hard science ’ and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction ."
1938,"It is noteworthy , however , that the Royal Society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the House of Lords ' Select Committee on Science and Technology ( Royal Society 1989 : 40 ) ."
1939,"Fortunately , in addition to the actions of the world ‘ hard science ’ community , a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists ( Fuchs 1989 ; Jacobson and Price 1990 ) ."
1940,"Currently this is organized and sponsored by the International Social Science Council ( ISSC ) , the UN University and the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies ."
1941,Its objectives are to :
1942,Improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total Earth system ;
1943,"Study , explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment ;"
1944,Identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable ;
1945,Analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development .
1946,"Jacobson and Price ( 1990 ) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to , and are affected by , likely global changes ; in particular , they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of GIS in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation ."
1947,The ISSC proposed its own work programme in the Human Dimensions of Global Change in late 1990 .
1948,"While these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change , others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base ."
1949,A leading example of this is the European Science Foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change ( ESF 1990 ) .
1950,Governmental and political involvement
1951,"The spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated : in 1972 , 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas , a decade later the number was 144 ( WEC 1985 ) ."
1952,"In most countries , the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people : the early development of the Green Party in the Federal Republic of Germany is something of an exception ."
1953,"Such a commitment to the environment is , none the less , both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing , let alone forthcoming , environmental problems ."
1954,The ‘ conversion ’ of the UK government has been briefly described earlier ; it is manifested in their July 1989 commitment to spend £10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the Advisory Board for the Research Councils ( ABRC ) for an extra £11m. in 1990 and £13m. in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research .
1955,"Perhaps the most significant development of all , however , is the increasing role of the European Commission ."
1956,"Their role in bringing environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) on to the statute book is well known , but the Commission has now made a proposal ( CEC 1989 ) for the ‘ establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Monitoring and Information Network ’ ."
1957,"The Commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a European scale , nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a Community-wide basis ( a realization brought about through the CORINE programme described later ) ."
1958,"The objectives of the new agency would be to assist the Community and the Member States to achieve the goals set out in the Treaty of Rome and in successive environmental action programmes ; it must also , however , be seen in the context of the European Council 's adoption on 2 December 1988 of the Rhodes Declaration on the Environment and the environment chapter in the Single European Act which comes into effect in 1992 ."
1959,The detailed specific roles of ‘ the System ’ ( comprising both agency and network ) are envisaged as :
1960,"To provide the Community , the Member States and participating third countries with the objective ( sic ) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies ;"
1961,"In particular , to provide technical , scientific and economic information requested by the Commission in its tasks of identification , preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation ;"
1962,To stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time ;
1963,"To help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the Community as well as the integration of European environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes , such as those established within the framework of the United Nations and its system of agencies ."
1964,Considerable stress is laid by the Commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the Community 's borders .
1965,It is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing State of the European Environment report ( CEC 1988 ) through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it .
1966,"Priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality , water resources and quality ( including the marine environment ) , soil erosion and pollution and important land resources , and biotopes and nature conservation ."
1967,"At the time of writing , the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency 's headquarters ."
1968,It seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in Europe and on the policies of component governments .
1969,"Yet this is by no means the only plan which the Community has in relation to the environment : Directorate-General XII ( that for Science , Research and Development ) has published details of an extensive R&D programme ( CEC 1990a ) and the Commission as a whole ( CEC 1990b ) has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment ."
1970,"Certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector , notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis ."
1971,"Derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution , predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value ."
1972,"However , significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain : thus IBM UK Ltd has donated £3.5m. of computing equipment to UNEP and IBM in general is actively supporting other R&D which can be expected to facilitate ‘ sustainable development ’ : IBM Europe , for instance , has invested $16m. in its Bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company 's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development ."
1973,"On a more modest basis , IBM UK have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in Birkbeck College to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population ."
1974,"Many other companies , of course , are supporting environmental work but IBM seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating ‘ sustainable development ’ ."
1975,Some examples of environmental monitoring projects
1976,"At the local scale , it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating ."
1977,An example of environmental modelling and prediction where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by Haber and Schaller ( 1988 ) .
1978,"Their work formed part of one UNESCO Man and Biosphere ( MAB ) project , carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria ."
1979,"Following Holling ( 1978 ) and Grossman ( 1983 ) , they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels :"
1980,"The lowest , or process , level , is directly and ( usually ) obviously connected to perceived reality ."
1981,"Thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious , simple and linear ; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous ."
1982,"This level is readily handled in commercial GIS ; ,"
1983,"The intermediate , or dynamic , level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events , e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire , frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace ."
1984,"Characteristically , the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated ; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential ;"
1985,"The top , or strategic , level is the most difficult to explore ; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means ."
1986,Relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available .
1987,The Haber and Schaller approach is to ‘ soft-couple ’ these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model .
1988,Results of running this with different scenarios include ‘ time slice ’ maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area .
1989,"While ultimately qualitative , it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events ."
1990,The national and continental scale : the CORINE project
1991,The CORINE programme represents the product of much activity by the European Commission 's Directorate-General ( XI ) for the Environment .
1992,"It originates from an Italian request to the Council of Ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally ‘ balanced ’ and ‘ unbalanced ’ areas in the Community ; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and , though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one , funding for this was not secured until 1985 ."
1993,"A 4-year experimental programme to ‘ collect , co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Communities ’ was set up and labelled CORINE ."
1994,"The objectives of CORINE were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states , developing methods for holding , analysing and presenting the data , and encouraging the exchange of data ."
1995,"A number of priority areas were identified , including biotopes of importance for nature conservation , acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the Mediterranean region ( Briggs and Martin 1988 ) ."
1996,Many achievements can be claimed by the CORINE project team .
1997,"Various aspects of the CORINE project have been described in papers by Rhind et al. ( 1986 ) , Wiggins et al. ( 1987 ) , Briggs and Martin ( 1988 ) , Briggs and Mounsey ( 1989 ) and CEC ( 1990c ) ."
1998,"For the present purposes , however , the key findings are :"
1999,"Many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies , confidentiality constraints , cost or non-collection in certain countries ;"
2000,"The unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables , e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the Member States and ‘ maximum temperature ’ at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways ;"
2001,The compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases ( see Rhind and Clark 1988 ) is often difficult ;
2002,User expectations are often unreasonably high ; use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions .
2003,"The ‘ fuzzy ’ nature of much geographically distributed data , the inherent errors in it , the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future ;"
2004,More detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of CORINE grows .
2005,The European Commission 's proposal for an environment agency ( see above ) will subsume the CORINE team and databases .
2006,The global scale : NASA and GEMS/GRID
2007,"Without question , the largest ‘ player ’ in the global environment arena is NASA ."
2008,"The organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are under discussion — the IGBP , for instance , has been strongly influenced by NASA proposals ."
2009,A summary of current activities and future plans is given in NASA ( 1988b ) .
2010,"By way of example , current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone , on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth 's radiation budget ."
2011,"Approved future programmes include the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite , the NASA Scatterometer and the joint NASA/CNES Ocean Topography Experiment ."
2012,"In addition , however , funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme — the Earth Observing System ( EOS ) ."
2013,This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC ( see above ) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP .
2014,"It will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms , one European Space Agency platform , a Japanese one and also from the manned space station ."
2015,"On this basis , a data flow of no less than 1 terabyte ( i.e. 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day is anticipated by the mid-1990s ."
2016,A major user of NASA data and skills has been the UN Environment Programme .
2017,"formed in the wake of the 1972 Stockholm conference , UNEP soon spawned the Global Environment Monitoring System ( GEMS ) as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical , scientific and management information on the environment ."
2018,The need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early 1980s and the Global Resources Information Database ( GRID ) resulted .
2019,"Mooneyhan ( 1988 ) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase ; GRID is now involved in integrating , storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases , mostly acquired from NASA ."
2020,"In addition to the work being carried out in the UNEP HQ at Nairobi and in the GEMS/GRID site in Geneva , a series of GRID regional nodes are now being set up world-wide , each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data ."
2021,The first of these is in Bangkok and another is to be opened in Latin America .
2022,"Moreover , national nodes are also being set up ; the recent IBM gift to GRID ( see above ) has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many African countries , together with national and continental data sets ."
2023,Training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for GRID staff .
2024,Technical aspects and problems
2025,It follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data .
2026,These are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction :
2027,"The use of secondary data , rather than primary data collected by the data analyst ;"
2028,"The need , at least with data on the terrestrial environment , for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary ( and often proxy ) data ;"
2029,The data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities ;
2030,The analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of ‘ high priests ’ ;
2031,"We have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results , let alone of predictions ."
2032,Some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail ; it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves .
2033,Remote sensing as a data collection process
2034,"As the need for more extensive , high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing , increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable ."
2035,No other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states .
2036,"The problem is now recognized , especially in Europe , and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets ( e.g. through the use of standard classifications , such as that for land use produced by the Conference of European Statisticians in 1989 ) ."
2037,"At present , however , ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal ."
2038,"Recognizing this , NASA ( 1988a ) concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions : 1 km resolution in XY and 10–100 m resolution in Z on a global basis , 100 m XY resolution and 1–10 m resolution in Z for regional databases and 10 m XY resolution and 0.1–1 m in Z for local studies ."
2039,They argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term : the availability of stereometric data from the French SPOT satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial ( XY ) resolution of about 30 m ( Muller 1989 ) .
2040,"For many terrestrial purposes , however , a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information ( in contrast , more direct measurements of sea state , etc. are possible ) ."
2041,"The value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene , the spatial , temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used ."
2042,"Thus far , for instance , accuracies of land cover ( let alone what is often needed , i.e. land use ) determined from Landsat and SPOT imagery for the UK have rarely been higher than 70 per cent unless trivial classifications ( e.g. built/unbuilt land ) have been used ."
2043,"One solution to this is to ‘ densify ’ the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional , spectrally based ones ."
2044,"But the ground conditions in some parts of Europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain : some areas of Portugal , for instance , have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping ."
2045,A further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits .
2046,Relatively few cost/benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation ( where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else 's money ) .
2047,It may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the British National Space Centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing ; it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of Professor Pearce ( see above ) as the adviser to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment .
2048,Other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the French government by Professor Didier ( 1990 ) .
2049,"Finally , since data are often costly to acquire , it follows that summaries of them e.g. The State of the European Environment report ( CEC 1988 ) and the Environmental Data Report of the UN EP ( GEMS MARC 1989 ) are of considerable value ."
2050,"Equally , the ‘ signposting ’ role now being adopted by UNEP 's GRID project — which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 — is to be welcomed ."
2051,The data problem and partial solutions
2052,The lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above .
2053,"In the European Community of 12 nation states , for instance , no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use !"
2054,"The need for harmonization is obvious and , in this respect , must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of EUROSTAT in harmonizing the definitions in trade , demographic and other ‘ social science ’ statistics ( see CEC 1990b ) ."
2055,An additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago .
2056,"By 1995/96 , they will be very much greater , notably from the EOS programme ."
2057,NASA has announced plans to collect up to 1 terabyte ( 10&sup12 ; bytes ) day .
2058,"Since remote sensing data sets ( especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe ) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate , transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful ( e.g. land cover ) data , the processing power required is going to be formidable ."
2059,"Other , non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but more complex in structure and in their characteristics ."
2060,To hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the European Community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage .
2061,"Parenthetically , the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced ."
2062,"It would be technically possible , for instance , to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world , akin to that collected about everyone in the UK through the Census of Population ."
2063,"In practice , legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form ; the cross-tabulations commonly employed ( e.g. to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex ) often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes ."
2064,"This all presents major problems of data storage , handling ( especially for global data sets ) , display and dissemination ."
2065,"Fortunately , technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 years over the last three decades ."
2066,"Indeed , this may grossly under-represent the present situation : the rapid spread of UNIX-based systems seems to facilitate competition and , at the time of writing , performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 per cent per annum ."
2067,"Moreover , the advent of low-cost , high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a CD-ROM , for instance , can hold about 600 megabytes ( i.e. 10&sup6 ; bytes ) , can be reproduced currently for about £1 and read on a device costing about £400 ."
2068,"Yet , despite such revolutionary changes in technology , novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets ."
2069,One such solution is Goodchild and Yang 's ( 1989 ) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth .
2070,A particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data .
2071,The literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account — but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved .
2072,Goodchild ( 1988 ) has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date .
2073,"Finally , relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource , available to a wide community : many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and ‘ lost ’ once the urgency of the initial research is over ."
2074,"However , the 1990 report of the Data and Facilities Working Group of the UK Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role ."
2075,It also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance ; this may be more difficult in ‘ within country ’ data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost .
2076,Global environmental research and the social sciences
2077,"Thus far , the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction ."
2078,That is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists .
2079,"Yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels , the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists , and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others ."
2080,"For geographers — who span the conventional ( and now archaic ) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences — all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change , the redistributions in trade , health and wealth which they will bring about and the ‘ knock on ’ effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment ."
2081,"For social scientists , then , environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance , especially as ‘ globalization ’ of markets and economies proceeds ."
2082,The Economic and Social Research Council ( ESRC ) commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding .
2083,These reports ( Pearce 1990 ; Turner 1990 ) may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the UK social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change .
2084,"Pearce ( 1990 ) , for instance , presented an economist 's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows :"
2085,"The theory and practice of international agreements , viewed in a game theory context ;"
2086,"The theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty ; ,"
2087,"Cost-benefit frameworks , especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects ;"
2088,Definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern Europe and the developing countries ;
2089,Appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases ;
2090,Assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest ;
2091,Economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases ;
2092,The international politics of climate change ;
2093,National and global energy options given the greenhouse effect ;
2094,Trade and global change .
2095,Turner ( 1990 ) argued that the priorities are as follows :
2096,The socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise ;
2097,Techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects ;
2098,"An assessment of management tools , institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change ;"
2099,Studies of agriculture in relation to climate change ;
2100,Understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact ;
2101,The interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics .
2102,"There is , then , no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change ."
2103,Some of it is being carried out : in March 1991 ESRC announced a £6m programme of research on Global Environmental Change .
2104,"However , perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research ."
2105,"In the USA at least , there needs to be an improvement in scientists ' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research ( see Kitsos and Ashe 1989 ) ."
2106,"All too often , it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous ( see Table 9.2 ) ."
2107,"Fortunately , considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal , political and institutional aspects of global environmental change ( see , for instance , Nitze 1990 ) ."
2108,The contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the World Ocean Climate Experiment or the World Climate Research Programme .
2109,Nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the UK ( as elsewhere ) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments .
2110,The consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound — as the European Commission has recognized in issuing a directive on public access to environmental data ( CEC 1990d ) — yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion .
2111,"Despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available , what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction ."
2112,Such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of ‘ actors ’ already involved is vast .
2113,"What is clear , however , is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise , that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes ."
2114,"In these circumstances , it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute , as Terney ( 1989 ) has chronicled in regard to IGBP ."
2115,"Moreover , as Newby ( 1990 ) has pointed out , the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy : ‘ in the past , … the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective ‘ hard ’ facts on which to base their soft , value-ridden policies … ."
2116,"But now we find scientists delivering only ‘ soft ’ , uncertain ‘ facts ’ to decision-makers facing ‘ hard ’ decisions . ’"
2117,"Yet , even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists , it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations ."
2118,We shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments — certainly in the European Community — to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form ( CEC 1990b ) .
2119,"More than that , it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies ."
2120,"Perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring , modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines ."
2121,Building such research teams is essential .
2122,"Underlying it all , however , is one obvious fact : that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth ."
2123,Thanks are due to Tina Buckle and Jonathan Raper for remastering the diagrams .
2124,"The UK ESRC supported the work of the South East Regional Research Laboratory in Birkbeck College , University of London , from which this review has grown ."
2125,Managing natural and technological hazards
2126,Anthony C. Gatrell and Peter Vincent
2127,"Few areas of the application of GIS technology can be as socially significant , or environmentally relevant , as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards ."
2128,"Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies , developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances , or monitoring the health implications of a disaster , GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions ."
2129,The 1990s have been declared the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .
2130,"Let us hope that G1S can , in some small way , help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which , as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the UK , can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places ."
2131,"Research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social , environmental and mathematical sciences ."
2132,"If , for instance , we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion , assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require , for example , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models , epidemiology and population distribution ."
2133,Some researchers suggest that hazards ( and emergencies that might result ) can be regarded as either natural or technological .
2134,"We shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former ( see , for instance , Burton et al. 1978 and Perry 1981 ) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter ."
2135,There are signs that this imbalance is being rectified ( Zeigler et al. 1983 ) .
2136,"Hazard research , like few other GIS application areas , is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies ."
2137,"In this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved GIS rather than for GIS looking for good problems , as is all too often the case ."
2138,What are hazards ?
2139,"Formally , a hazard can be defined as : ‘ a physical situation with a potential for human injury , damage to property , damage to the environment , or some combination of these ’ ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 30 ) ."
2140,"A hazard is a threat which , given a set of circumstances , may become translated into a realized event ."
2141,"What we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude : we speak for instance of accidents , emergencies , disasters and catastrophes , each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequences ."
2142,"On 30 March 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century , the Bezymianny eruption , occurred ."
2143,Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties .
2144,"In contrast , the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when , during October 1961 , the island 's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island 's only settlement were evacuated to the UK ."
2145,These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area .
2146,"As noted above , the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced ."
2147,Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates ( 1964 ) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) in distinguishing public ( or what we might call societal ) hazards from private ( individual ) ones .
2148,The further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards .
2149,"Zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods , those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers ."
2150,"The United Nations Disaster Relief Organization ( UNDRO ) has produced a classification of disasters , derived on the basis of case data ( Table 10.1 ) ."
2151,"UNDRO recognizes three basic types of disaster : accidents , natural events , and other disasters ."
2152,The differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies .
2153,"However , the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here ."
2154,"It is more useful ( Johnson 1983 ) to adopt a non-partitional scheme ( fig. 10.1 ) that recognizes , for instance , food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard , or lead pollution ( e.g. from car exhausts ) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard ( both public and private ) ."
2155,"An air crash ( as at Lockerbie ) affects an entire community directly , as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller ."
2156,Hillslope failure ( as at Aberfan in South Wales in 1966 ) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction .
2157,Dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs .
2158,Hohensemer et al. ( 1983 ) make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimensions along which any hazard may be scored ( see Table 10.2 ) .
2159,"These factors will , of course , be important in deciding on the role that GIS can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning ."
2160,"For instance , some events will persist briefly , have immediate consequences , minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality ( an air crash is an example ) ."
2161,"Others , such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas , may persist for a week or more , have delayed consequences , may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations ."
2162,There may be more scope for a GIS approach in the latter than in the former situations .
2163,"The Hohensemer scheme is not , however , beyond criticism ."
2164,"for example , can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality ?"
2165,Industrial hazards and risk assessment
2166,Once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk .
2167,By ‘ risk ’ we understand ‘ the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances ’ ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 30 ) .
2168,"It may , of course , be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals ."
2169,"Technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare , so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk , especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency ."
2170,"The identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known , together with the dangerous substances stored or processed there ."
2171,In the UK ( see Petts 1988 for a splendid overview ) the Health and Safety Executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled .
2172,"Such substances and thresholds include , for instance , 25 tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate , and 10 tonnes of toxic chlorine gas ."
2173,"Some 1600 installations are notifiable , along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines ( mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines ) ."
2174,"Following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities ( including those at Flixborough , Humberside in 1974 ; Beek , the Netherlands in 1975 ; and Seveso and Manfredonia in Italy in 1976 ) , the EC issued a Directive on Major Accident Hazards ."
2175,"The Directive , which is commonly referred to as the ‘ Seveso ’ Directive , was issued in June 1982 and in the UK its requirements were embodied in the Control of Major Accident Hazard ( CIMAH ) Regulations ( 1984 ) ."
2176,"Among other things , these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations ( Houston 1987 ) ."
2177,There are presently about 300 CIMAH sites .
2178,"However , many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations ."
2179,"Clearly , a plant which stores 1 tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net , while large numbers of handling sites ( warehouses , for instance ) are not covered ."
2180,"The regulations have obvious implications for G1S work , as illustrated below ."
2181,"In Halton Borough , Cheshire , for instance , there are 13 notifiable installations , with over 20 000 people living within the defined ‘ consultation zones ’ ( Petts 1988 ) ."
2182,It is also relevant to point out here the work of the Health and Safety Executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 ) .
2183,"Such techniques include the use of a ‘ risk assessment tool ’ ( RISKAT ) , inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed ; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours ."
2184,In societal risk assessment ‘ it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation .
2185,"This can be a difficult and time-consuming process , and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed ’ ( Health and Safety Executive 1989 : 17 ) ."
2186,"Again , the G1S implications are clear and are discussed below ."
2187,The disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years .
2188,"The rather clumsy handling by NIREX of the search for sites to store low- and intermediate-level wastes , together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , are but two examples of such concern in the UK ."
2189,"However , while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers ( summarized by Openshaw et al. 1989 ) there has been relatively little such work in the UK on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes ."
2190,"This contrasts with the situation in the USA ( Greenberg and Anderson 1984 ) , where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority ."
2191,"Certainly , in terms of the volume of waste generated in the UK non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda ; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985–86 , 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes ( Openshaw et al. 1989 : 13 ) ."
2192,Attention should be drawn to the three Annual Reports of the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate ( now merged with other branches of the DoE to form Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Pollution ) .
2193,"These contain some valuable material on disposal practices , and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority ( WRA ) — counties in England , districts in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland ."
2194,Each WRA is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear .
2195,"They too contain useful material on , for instance , the locations of sites , though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes ."
2196,"What is not known is information on the locations of former sites , at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped , though recent work by Egger ( 1989 ) in Austria has mapped a vast number of such sites ."
2197,"It is these , rather than existing , licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity , particularly when examining possible links to ill health ."
2198,"We simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that ‘ people are almost certainly ill , dead , or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities ’ ( Openshaw et al. 1989 : 12 ) ."
2199,"Research is in progress , however , to assess possible health effects of poor incineration ( Diggle et al. 1990 ) ."
2200,"Particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators , since these have been subject to Crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes ( Gatrell and Lovett 1991 ) ."
2201,"We need to produce an inventory of all such sites , together with a publicly available , comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes ."
2202,It is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning .
2203,Nuclear emergency planning in the UK has been reviewed by Matthews and Pepper ( 1981 ) .
2204,Nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Health and Safety Executive for approval .
2205,Evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km ; these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services .
2206,"The very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the USA ( Collins 1981 ) , where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes ."
2207,"Local authorities in the UK that have declared themselves ‘ nuclear-free ’ have been highly critical of British planning , calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least 24 km ."
2208,Zeigler et al. ( 1983 ) should be consulted for material relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at Three Mile Island .
2209,"In the UK little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances , nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning ."
2210,"Indeed , no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify ."
2211,"In the USA on the other hand , a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken ."
2212,"This research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Tennessee ( Sorenson et al. 1987 ; Vogt and Sorenson 1987 ) and the Disaster Research Centre , University of Delaware ."
2213,"Perry ( 1985 ) has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation , covering both natural and technological hazards ."
2214,"For him , comprehensive emergency planning and management involve : prevention , protection , response and restoration ."
2215,"By prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk , perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments , for instance ."
2216,Included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected .
2217,"Response includes search and rescue ( including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion , or fire following an earthquake ) ."
2218,"As Perry and others have noted , relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects , the bulk going to response and restoration ( rebuilding ) ."
2219,It should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical .
2220,In one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event Liverman and Wilson ( 1981 ) give weight to this argument .
2221,"In 1979 a train carrying chlorine , liquid petroleum , toluene and propane was derailed in Mississauga , Ontario , causing a series of explosions ."
2222,"This led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which , although staggered over several days , led to great pressure on transport arteries ."
2223,"An important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away , rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres ."
2224,"Despite this , the evacuation was successful , partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated ."
2225,"In addition , the police were well prepared , stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby Toronto International Airport than for the event in question ."
2226,"It is not without interest to note that in the USA there is a Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , established in 1978 , charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management ."
2227,"In the UK there is no equivalent , though the spate of disasters in the past 4 years ( involving over 1000 lives lost ) has led to several calls for such a national body to be established ."
2228,In this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to GIS .
2229,"Needless to say , the study of natural hazards is important , a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to 4 per cent of total deaths in the world each year ( Mitchell , 1974 ) ."
2230,"In 1970 , for example , more than 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of Bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricanes David and Frederick caused more than $3bn damage in the USA ."
2231,Shah ( 1983 ) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974–80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude ( measured in terms of lives lost ) are increasing .
2232,"High death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed , low-income countries ."
2233,"Surprisingly , fog is the third most important hazard in Europe after floods and volcanoes ."
2234,Research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century .
2235,Much of the impetus for such research arose in the USA from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage .
2236,The vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events per se and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards .
2237,"This emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved ( many are human geographers and sociologists ) and partly because it is only really since the Second World War that major hazards have been monitored systematically , culminating , of course , in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology ."
2238,"Brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a GIS approach , applications of which are considered below ."
2239,Jones et al. ( 1989 ) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the UK .
2240,Their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the UK .
2241,"More to the point , however , is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes , rainfall , rock types and so on ."
2242,In other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified .
2243,"The potential benefits to insurance companies , engineers and planners are clear ."
2244,"Second , a well-known winter hazard in the UK , with marked spatial localization , is fog ."
2245,Predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety .
2246,"Perry ( 1981 ) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography , environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies ."
2247,"Reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations , often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas ; GIS could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like ."
2248,The majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type .
2249,This idea led Hewitt and Burton ( 1971 ) to develop the concept of ‘ all-hazards-at-a-place ’ .
2250,The implications for GIS in the development of ‘ hazardousness ’ indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps .
2251,The collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time .
2252,Many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence .
2253,This is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes .
2254,"For example , in 1692 , the whole of southern England was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now Belgium ; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted ( Morse 1983 ) ."
2255,Presumably the builders of the Channel Tunnel are aware of this ?
2256,"This is , of course , a vast subject area , embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health ."
2257,"It covers , for instance , the associations between water and air pollution and ill health , links between geological and pedological environments and ill health , as well as associations between specific technological hazards ( e.g. high-voltage power lines ) and possible health effects ."
2258,"We can only consider a small fraction of this work here ; little consideration is given to occupational environments , for instance ."
2259,"In the UK such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at Southampton and Cardiff ( funded by the Medical Research Council ) , and others at the University of Surrey ( Robens Institute ) and at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ."
2260,"The latter houses the Small Area Health Statistics Research Unit ( SAHSRU ) , which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales ( Elliot 1988 ) ."
2261,The SAHSRU liaises closely with OPCS .
2262,The kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below .
2263,Greenberg ( 1983 ) and a collection of papers in Greenberg ( 1987 ) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology .
2264,It seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed .
2265,"One is to collect morbidity and mortality data ( usually the latter is more widely available , though the former more useful ) and to examine spatial distributions for clustering ."
2266,This has itself generated a substantial literature ( see the papers in Elliot 1988 for an overview ) and is nowhere better exemplified than in Openshaw 's geographical analysis machine ( see Ch. 2 ) .
2267,We then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations .
2268,An alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis .
2269,If an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further .
2270,"Of course , these two approaches are not clear-cut in practice ; in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping ."
2271,One example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health .
2272,"Some work ( Perry et al. 1981 ) suggested associations with mental illness and suicide , while others ( e.g. Wertheimer and Leeper 1982 ) have examined links to various cancers , including leukaemias ."
2273,A good bibliography is provided in Perry and Pearl ( 1988 ) .
2274,"The Central Electricity Generating Board ( now privatized and split into two companies ) is funding a large-scale , 2-year project to assess links to childhood cancer , while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death ."
2275,"One obvious problem , with implications for any GIS input , is that the effects are highly localized , with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines ."
2276,Accuracy of digital data collection ( either of the power lines or residential locations ) is paramount .
2277,There seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment .
2278,"GIS work in this field ( e.g. Matthews 1989 ) is reviewed later , but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at Imperial College ( responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry ) and the existence of a Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health ."
2279,One area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer .
2280,"This is taken very seriously in the USA , where the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 10 000–20 000 deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure ."
2281,Estimates from Scandinavia suggest that 10–30 per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon ( Richardson 1988 : 270–81 ) .
2282,The gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil ; thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of Cornwall and Devon .
2283,"There are great difficulties in assessing health effects , however , since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods ."
2284,Carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors .
2285,Other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the Regional Research Laboratory ( RRL ) initiative include air and water pollution .
2286,"The debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known ; less publicity has been given to PAHs ( polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons ) , a product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic ( Lioy and Daisey 1987 ) ."
2287,Research at the North West Regional Research Laboratory ( NWRRL ) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the Cancer Registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer .
2288,"Those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the Warren Springs Laboratory , containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the UK ."
2289,"The possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is the subject of much debate ( Beresford 1985 ) , as is the association between aluminium content and Alzheimer 's disease ."
2290,"The problems of assessing such links are , of course , huge , but there is scope for a contribution ."
2291,The role of GIS in hazard management scenarios — examples
2292,"As we have already implied , GIS has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research , from hazard monitoring , risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences ."
2293,"The examples described below illustrate all these , though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which GIS has played a significant part ."
2294,"Technological hazards , emergency planning and GIS"
2295,A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply GIS methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites .
2296,Much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system .
2297,"Reference was made above to so-called CIMAH sites , major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared ."
2298,"Early research at the NWRRL focused on developing a GIS for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in Cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in Whitehaven , west Cumbria ( Vincent et al. 1988 ; Dunn 1989 ) ."
2299,The police required a portable system that could be implemented on an IBM-compatible microcomputer .
2300,This was written at the NWRRL using FORTRAN 77 and the Graphical Kernel System .
2301,The GIS is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly ( Pl. 10.1 ) .
2302,It opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners .
2303,Full zoom facilities are available at any stage .
2304,In any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources .
2305,The system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data .
2306,"Both sets of data were provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd , who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country ."
2307,"Other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools , medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained ."
2308,The GIS permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map .
2309,"Most significantly , it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes ."
2310,"Although predating the RRL initiative by several years — and , indeed the emergence of GIS as a major research area — we should remind ourselves of Openshaw 's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites ."
2311,"Using what would now be called GIS skills , Openshaw ( 1980 ) examined over 13 000 1 km grid squares in the UK which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 Census ( which were made available for such grid squares ) ."
2312,"He demonstrated that there is an abundance of ‘ remote ’ sites , in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find ."
2313,He suggested that in early spatial searches for sites ‘ only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data ’ ( Openshaw 1980 : 289 ) .
2314,Heywood and Cornelius ( 1989 ) have shown how GIS can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of GIS in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring .
2315,"They propose a national radiological spatial information system and , in a pilot project in Cumbria , have integrated several layers of data within ARC/INFO to show what this might involve ( Fig. 10.2 ) ."
2316,Such data include those from the Population and Agricultural Censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations .
2317,"As an example , the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 ."
2318,This is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations .
2319,"The map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , with the exception of a small area to the south-east of Cumbria , bordering on Lancashire ."
2320,The British government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the Chernobyl accident .
2321,"The DoE , through Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Pollution ( HMIP ) , was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan , installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency ( HMSO 1988 ) ."
2322,"The monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network ( RIMNET ) and has , as its prime responsibility , the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the UK of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident ."
2323,The full implementation of the RIMNET system will take some time .
2324,By the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at 46 meteorological stations as part of phase 1 of the development programme .
2325,Radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data .
2326,"The current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background , either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites ."
2327,"The dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels : the first is the normal system of press notices ; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata ( Ceefax and Prestel ) to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work ; the third is the use of Telecom Gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies , such as water authorities ( Jackson 1989 ) ."
2328,Phase 2 of the RIMNET scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring sites will have been established .
2329,"Given very wide regional and local variations in deposition , questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network ; local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks ."
2330,There are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later .
2331,"Abroad , Kaspar ( 1981 ) has discussed a computer-based exercise , with GIS overtones , involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in Baden Württemberg ."
2332,"In the scenario he outlines , an area affected by radioactive releases is determined , the population within that area is allocated to reception areas ( with capacity constraints ) , evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented ."
2333,"Little detail is provided , however , and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully ."
2334,Dangermond ( 1985 ) describes the use of the ARC/INFO NETWORK module for use in emergency planning situations .
2335,"He describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation , districting and routeing algorithms ."
2336,"Allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre ; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest ( districts ) and to summarize their characteristics ; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network , the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions , road capacity and so on ."
2337,"Dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of NETWORK for the allocation of emergency vehicles , optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks ."
2338,"When combined with the other facilities in ARC/INFO , quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled ."
2339,"For example , earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model ."
2340,Vincent ( 1989 ) illustrates the use of ARC/INFO and its NETWORK module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west England ( Pl. 10.2 ) .
2341,"In this case , population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm ."
2342,Chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance .
2343,"There can be little doubt that a GIS approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize ( rather than , as conventionally , maximize ) accessibility to a population ."
2344,A particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear ( but none the less hazardous ) wastes .
2345,We discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes .
2346,The major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers ( Openshaw et al. 1989 ) and a GIS approach to this problem can pay high dividends .
2347,The work of Carver ( see Openshaw et al. 1989 : Ch. 7 ) is an interesting example .
2348,One advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation .
2349,The authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories ( which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter ) .
2350,"Data layers include geological maps , conservation areas , transport routes , petrochemical facilities and demographic data ."
2351,"As different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks ( Pl. 10.3 ) ; for instance , when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository , 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent ."
2352,"However , adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 per cent ; and so on ."
2353,We can not pretend GIS is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public .
2354,GIS research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in North America and has yet to be matched in the UK .
2355,"Jensen and Christiansen ( 1986 ) , working in the south-eastern USA , use a raster approach ( with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2 ; ) and Boolean overlay to ‘ weed out ’ particular sites , such as those which are poorly drained , environmentally sensitive or inaccessible ( see also Stewart 1987 ) ."
2356,Environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the USA .
2357,"The Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) legislation of 1980 ( ‘ Superfund ’ ) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites , of which some 800 had been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency by 1986 ( Foresman 1986 ) ."
2358,A major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using GIS to monitor this ( Merchant et al. 1987 ; Barringer et al. 1987 ; von Braun 1988 ) .
2359,"This is an important topic since 95 per cent of rural households in the USA consume only groundwater , while half the US population consumes at least some groundwater ( Merchant et al. 1987 ) ."
2360,"Clearly , the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data , usually in three dimensions ."
2361,"As Foresman ( 1986 ) suggests , we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role ."
2362,"Merchant et al. ( 1987 ) for example , use the image processing system ERDAS to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution ; this uses variables such as depth to water table , soil type , slope and so on ( see Estes et al. 1987 for a similar approach ) ."
2363,Barringer et al. ( 1987 ) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality ( hardness and corrosivity measures ) and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices .
2364,"Again , a raster-based approach is used ."
2365,"A further example is work by von Braun ( 1988 ) who uses pMAP to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of Tucson airport , Arizona ."
2366,Using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated .
2367,Overlaying the results with residential location data provides ‘ maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period ’ ( von Braun 1988 ; 1160 ) .
2368,"In principle , it is then possible to compare such ‘ doses ’ with epidemiological data , once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes ."
2369,Attention should be drawn to Foresman 's comment that the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) ( at the EROS Data Centre ) have successfully linked ARC/INFO to a model of groundwater flow ( Foresman 1986 : 260 ) .
2370,This kind of link between GIS and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the NWRRL in linking GIS and air pollution plume models .
2371,Natural hazards and disaster management
2372,Several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of GIS in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards .
2373,"Berke and Ruch ( 1985 ) , for example , describe a GIS for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the Texas Gulf coast ."
2374,Hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the USA .
2375,"It has been estimated , for example , that during the mid 1970s some 50 million US citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over 160 km/h and 6 million were subject to hurricane surge ( Brinkman 1975 ) ."
2376,"The system described by Berke and Ruch ( 1985 ) is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called SLOSH ( Sea , Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes ) ."
2377,"SLOSH is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities , angles of approach to the shoreline , forward movement speeds and landfall locations ."
2378,Additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves .
2379,Hobeika and Jamei ( 1985 ) describe the MASSeVACuation ( MASSVAC ) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area .
2380,The system comprises three interrelated modules : community and disaster type characteristics module ; population distribution module ; network evacuation module .
2381,The type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated .
2382,The control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario .
2383,MASSVAC is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as : traffic signal timings on the road network ; one-way traffic ; reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services .
2384,Hobeika and Jamei have tested MASSVAC on various evacuation scenarios for Virginia Beach City in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions .
2385,"In general , they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times ."
2386,Southworth et al. ( 1989 ) have enhanced the MASSVAC model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call MVOPL .
2387,This module has been developed using IBM 's Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens .
2388,"The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram , and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams ."
2389,The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation .
2390,"In dry parts of the world , such as Australia , forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts ."
2391,"Kessell ( 1988 ) describes a PC-based GIS called PREPLAN ( PRistine Environment Planning LANguage ) which is a natural area management , land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service , PREPLAN comprises four modules : a simple raster-based GIS ; a grid cell resource database ; a wide range of vegetation , fuel , fire behaviour , erosion and land-use models ; tabular , statistical and colour graphics output system ."
2392,"With this system real-time fire growth can be modelled , taking into account changes in terrain , fuel and temporal changes in the weather ."
2393,"Kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of Australia , causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life ."
2394,Systems such as PREPLAN can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning .
2395,"One of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding , and the potential for loss of property , risk to life and general social disruption is large ."
2396,"One interesting example of a GIS approach to flood damage estimation is the ANUFLOOD package which was developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern New South Wales , Australia ( Smith and Greenaway , 1988 ) ."
2397,"The ANUFLOOD system requires locational and building type data on individual properties , stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type , and lastly , flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability ."
2398,Output from the system is both tabular and graphical .
2399,Of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas .
2400,"ANUFLOOD also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options , such as property height raising , levee construction and flood proofing ."
2401,"The possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning , the search for hazardous sites , and risk assessment ."
2402,To what extent can GIS help if an event occurs ?
2403,"What , for instance , of the health consequences ?"
2404,There is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for GIS applications is wide ( Gatrell 1987 ) .
2405,"For instance , Diggle et al. ( 1990 ) assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this ."
2406,This would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data ( increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries ) to Ordnance Survey ( OS ) grid references .
2407,"Such a link is provided by the Central Postcode Directory , which matches all 1.5 million unit postcodes in the UK to grid references ."
2408,When the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a nan distribution ( provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer ) the hypothesis is given strong support .
2409,"Although the proposed method is novel , it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model ‘ clusters ’ of disease ( see , for example , Cuzick and Edwards 1990 ) ."
2410,"The work of Diggle et al. ( 1990 ) examined only a single point source , though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well ."
2411,As a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by Cross ( 1989 ) on childhood leukaemia .
2412,There are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease ( from ionizing radiation to viral transmission ) and Cross 's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use ARC/INFO to display and analyse results .
2413,"For instance , one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation , a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier ."
2414,If these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them ( Fig. 10.3 ) we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside .
2415,"However , we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data , since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m ( Wertheimer and Leeper 1982 ) ."
2416,"There has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of Wales may be linked to soil chemistry , specifically such factors as zinc/copper ratios , and to lead content in water supplies ."
2417,Matthews ( 1989 ) has used data from the Regional Cancer Registry ( morbidity rather than mortality data ) and data on trace elements to examine this link .
2418,Since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the OS grid reference .
2419,"As with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration , together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors ."
2420,"In the USA , Morrill 's report on the beginnings of a $15m. study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the Hanford ( Washington State ) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for GIS skills to be applied ( Morrill 1989 ) ."
2421,The research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records .
2422,To some extent this line of approach was anticipated by Johnson ( 1981 ) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver ( see Zeigler et al. 1983 : 47–8 ) .
2423,"Using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands , detecting a marked distance decay effect ."
2424,Research problems and prospects
2425,"The work reviewed above suggests that the application of GIS techniques to hazard assessment , emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems ."
2426,"Undoubtedly , the GISs of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors ."
2427,"Computer power is becoming cheaper , digital data more readily available , and GISs are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies ."
2428,In this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them .
2429,"Doubtless there are many others , such is the surge of interest in GIS technology ."
2430,But in some areas EDs are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted .
2431,"The database was created by a commercial company , Aspinwalls Ltd ."
2432,There are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work .
2433,One important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units .
2434,Grant 's remains were shovelled into a canvas bag .
2435,"They returned to the bridge , fearful of every dark place — every corner , every door ."
2436,"One , we get out of here now ."
2437,Nobody spoke immediately .
2438,Lawton nodded his agreement .
2439,‘ Nell ? ’
2440,Forster 's chuckle was mirthless .
2441,‘ No . ’
2442,Delaney was momentarily thoughtful .
2443,‘ Two of our number have been killed .
2444,"It was a safety suit , an advanced model of the NBC type with its own oxygen tanks ."
2445,I think it 's a good idea .
2446,"Behind the clear , wide vizor , he tried to smile ."
2447,"‘ Cosy in here , ’ he joked ."
2448,‘ Even got my own toilet .
2449,At the entrance to the laboratory complex the others drew on their own masks .
2450,Were unseen eyes watching them ?
2451,‘ Looks a good place . ’
2452,"‘ This must be the only way in , ’ Nell said ."
2453,Forster was quickly de-suited .
2454,Delaney 's voice was hushed .
2455,‘ Maybe we should leave two of us here ? ’
2456,Forster was adamant .
2457,Lawton came and crouched down in front of it .
2458,‘ Good luck . ’
2459,‘ I hope I do n't have to wait all night . ’
2460,The further away the better .
2461,The more time to see it approach .
2462,The trouble was the transverse corridor just outside the room .
2463,Lawton scanned upwards .
2464,‘ It could be anywhere .
2465,"Like Forster , all he could guess was that it was fast ."
2466,"Grant may have been lame , but … fast or silent ?"
2467,‘ What is it ? ’
2468,But there could be no doubt that fundamentally it was … human .
2469,"Nell knew , and not only because she was a female of the same species ."
2470,She could see in its eyes — intelligence .
2471,And human fear .
2472,"But also , as a doctor , she knew exactly what it was ."
2473,Forster scanned the corridor once more .
2474,It was empty .
2475,just as it always had been .
2476,"He sat back again , eyeing the blank wall before him , confident that he 'd catch it , however good it was ."
2477,Forster was a fatalist .
2478,But a door had opened somewhere .
2479,"Somebody , or something , had entered the complex ."
2480,It could be the others returning — or the start of his ambush .
2481,‘ For God 's sake leave your mask on .
2482,But Delaney 's plea was in vain .
2483,"Nell pulled it off , got close to the door , and shouted ."
2484,‘ We mean you no harm .
2485,You can help us . ’
2486,Lawton shook his head .
2487,‘ Ca n't hear you .
2488,Try the ship 's system again . ’
2489,"Nell ran to the wall telephone , and pushed the digit for engine room ."
2490,‘ What 's happening ? ’
2491,‘ Nothing now .
2492,‘ We ought to get on . ’
2493,Delaney nodded his agreement .
2494,"‘ Leave it , Nell . ’"
2495,‘ It 's not going anywhere . ’
2496,"‘ I ca n't , John ."
2497,"If we can get to it , I can learn so much more ."
2498,‘ Perhaps it would be better if it did . ’
2499,"‘ For God 's sake , Nell ."
2500,‘ Pathetic ? ’
2501,‘ It might be bloody dangerous .
2502,"Certainly , something on this ship is . ’"
2503,‘ I just know . ’
2504,Lawton gestured in the gangway .
2505,But Lawton was right .
2506,Delaney turned to Nell .
2507,"Do n't be bloody foolish like I am , leaving you here ."
2508,And do n't try and get the door open . ’
2509,But Nell was hardly listening .
2510,"To please him she nodded , then despite Lawton 's presence , squeezed Delaney 's arm ."
2511,‘ And you . ’
2512,‘ Watch out . ’
2513,"As they drew back up the stairs , piling on the pieces she threw up at them , Lawton sniffed ."
2514,Just slow it down . ’
2515,"‘ As long as there 's ti me , that 's all we need . ’"
2516,"She smiled shyly , then turned away ."
2517,There it went again .
2518,Forster frowned as he looked through his spy hole .
2519,The corridor was empty .
2520,It had happened three times now .
2521,"Satisfied that everything was as it should be , he checked his watch ."
2522,They ought to be near him soon .
2523,Forster searched in a pouch and came up with a glucose sweet .
2524,Forster choked as the putrefying reek seemed to get right into him .
2525,His heart was thumping .
2526,He had to get rid of it .
2527,"It was like a man breathing through a respiratory system , with some sort of one-way valve ."
2528,He was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the North Sea .
2529,"No one appeared as he drew up and , before lifting his hand to the bell , he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door ."
2530,"Ecclesiastes chapter 3 , verse 15 ."
2531,"It was , he thought , an interesting choice of text ."
2532,I 'm afraid Nora Gurney is implacable .
2533,Perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen . ’
2534,"The room , which contained nothing superfluous , nothing pretentious , was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and , for a moment , he wondered why ."
2535,But you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal . ’
2536,Hers had been perceptive .
2537,I 'm not sure that I really knew her and I 'm left wishing I 'd tried harder .
2538,But I shall miss her . ’
2539,Alice Mair said : ‘ I did n't know her either .
2540,Perhaps I should have tried harder too .
2541,Would you care to join us ?
2542,Seven thirty for eight . ’
2543,"It sounded , he thought , more like a challenge than an invitation ."
2544,Three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator .
2545,"Ahead of him , trudging along on the left of the path , was a little group of children , the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children , one each side of her , clutching the bars ."
2546,"He recognized the Blaney children , met once before with their mother walking along the beach ."
2547,Obviously the eldest girl had been shopping : the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags .
2548,Instinctively he slowed down .
2549,But the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home .
2550,He wondered whether Mrs Blaney was still alive .
2551,"His instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that , he knew , was hardly sensible ."
2552,"Alice Mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen , wiping her hands ."
2553,He said : ‘ The Blaney children are walking home .
2554,"I thought I could offer a lift if I had a woman with me , someone they know . ’"
2555,She said briefly : ‘ They know me . ’
2556,He asked : ‘ Is Mrs Blaney still alive ? ’
2557,She died six weeks ago . ’
2558,"‘ Not particularly well , I imagine ."
2559,When they drew up beside the little band it was Alice Mair who opened the car door and spoke .
2560,He 's Miss Dalgliesh 's nephew from Larksoken Mill .
2561,One of the twins had better sit on my lap .
2562,Their pathetically thin legs were unprotected .
2563,Theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of London 's Underground across the front .
2564,It was impossible to know what she was thinking .
2565,‘ Daddy has taken the van to Mr Sparks .
2566,It 's due for its MOT test .
2567,We have to have milk .
2568,And we wanted some more disposable nappies . ’
2569,"If your father agrees , would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month ? ’"
2570,"‘ What are you going to cook , Miss Mair ? ‘"
2571,‘ Put your head close so that I can whisper .
2572,Mr Dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests .
2573,I want it to be a surprise . ‘
2574,"When she reached the plateau she remained standing , watching for Joss Barnet , waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her ."
2575,There was no longer any need for her to be
2576,Or was she earlier than she thought ?
2577,"She was happy to wait for him , certain that soon she would see him riding towards her ."
2578,It could happen .
2579,"Or had his horse gone lame , cast a shoe ?"
2580,She sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary .
2581,Should she set off down the hill to meet him ?
2582,She had been mistaken ever to think that he would come .
2583,‘ I 'm ready to start now .
2584,I do n't want any breakfast . ’
2585,‘ Gone to New York ? ’
2586,How could she have thought that he would ?
2587,"Something unforeseen and urgent had happened , since Sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon , and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her ."
2588,‘ I would like some breakfast .
2589,Suddenly I 'm hungry .
2590,How should I know ?
2591,I do n't understand business .
2592,There 's plenty to be done . ’
2593,"‘ We 're going home , ’ she sobbed ."
2594,‘ I do n't want to go back to Mrs Gutermann 's .
2595,I want to stay with Edward .
2596,I want to live with him for ever and ever ! ’
2597,‘ How do you know we 're leaving ? ’ she asked .
2598,‘ Who told you ? ’
2599,"‘ Miss Fitch , ’ Anna wailed ."
2600,‘ I do n't like Miss Fitch .
2601,I hate her !
2602,I daresay she wants me to go ! ’
2603,"‘ Perhaps she 's mistaken , ’ Ruth said , though she doubted if Miss Fitch was ever wrong ."
2604,‘ We 'll ask your mama the moment she comes in . ’
2605,"‘ I 'm afraid it 's true , ’ Mrs Carson told them ."
2606,‘ Of course we were only invited for ten days or so . ’
2607,Mrs Carson smiled indulgently .
2608,‘ Dearest Anna !
2609,"‘ And the answer is , I do n't know ."
2610,Mrs Barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him .
2611,"‘ I hope you 're ready to help me , ’ she said ."
2612,"‘ I 'll help , Mrs Cranbrook , ’ Ruth agreed ."
2613,She tried to sound nonchalant .
2614,"Oh , you mean O'Farrell and the master ?"
2615,Not that I know of .
2616,There 's no telling when they ‘ U return .
2617,Mrs Cranbrook shrugged .
2618,Not for the likes of you and me to question why . ’
2619,"‘ It looks so different , ’ she said ."
2620,And now for my dress . ’
2621,"She looked beautiful in the yellow satin , the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure , the skirt billowing out ."
2622,"‘ Do n't worry , Ruth , ’ she said kindly ."
2623,Had she not been so downhearted Ruth would have enjoyed herself .
2624,Coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond .
2625,Already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear .
2626,"She climbed the stairs to her room , then undressed and went to bed , wetting the pillow with her tears which , held back all day , now flowed unchecked ."
2627,It was Joss Barnet .
2628,"‘ I ca n't , ’ she whispered ."
2629,‘ Someone will see the light under the door . ’
2630,"‘ No matter if they do , ’ he said ."
2631,‘ They will not think of me here .
2632,Only my coachman knows I am home .
2633,‘ You came to me first ? ’
2634,She could hardly believe it .
2635,"‘ Light the candle , ’ he repeated ."
2636,Then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time .
2637,"She turned her face away from him , pushed his hand from her ."
2638,‘ No ! ’ she cried .
2639,‘ You must not ! ’
2640,She tried again to push him away .
2641,Please do n't ! ’ she cried .
2642,"‘ I wo n't hurt you , ’ he said ."
2643,‘ Do n't be afraid . ’
2644,‘ I 'm not afraid of being hurt . ’
2645,‘ Then what … ? ’
2646,"‘ I 'm afraid of afterwards , ’ she said hesitantly ."
2647,"‘ But you wo n't , ’ he assured her ."
2648,I 'm not totally callous . ’
2649,‘ You promise ? ’
2650,‘ I promise . ’
2651,"Afterwards they lay quietly side by side , not speaking , until he said , ‘ I must go . ’"
2652,"‘ Not yet , ’ she begged ."
2653,‘ You ca n't leave me yet . ’
2654,"‘ You 're not a mortal man , ’ Ruth said ."
2655,He laughed out loud .
2656,‘ Hush ! ’ she cautioned .
2657,‘ Someone will hear you . ’
2658,"‘ I 'm a real man all right , ’ he said ."
2659,Then he stood up and quickly began to dress .
2660,"‘ Do n't leave me , ’ she begged ."
2661,‘ Please stay ! ’
2662,‘ But of course I must go .
2663,There 's no question . ’
2664,‘ When am I going to see you again ? ’ she asked .
2665,‘ But we leave tomorrow ! ’ she exclaimed .
2666,"‘ Oh no , ’ Ruth said ."
2667,‘ We 're going back to New York City . ’
2668,"He finished dressing , then came and held her by the shoulders , kissing her lightly on the mouth ."
2669,As he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed .
2670,"‘ From the city , ’ he said ."
2671,It should remain there for ever .
2672,She would never take it off .
2673,"We decided that Masquerade would sail from the Bahamas to Panama , and thence to the Galapagos where we would find Darwin 's giant tortoises ."
2674,We were happy .
2675,"Once in the boatyard Ellen ran ahead of me , evidently eager to reach Wavebreaker 's air conditioning ."
2676,"Then , as she reached the dock 's edge , she suddenly checked ."
2677,‘ What on earth is that ?
2678,"Oh , no ! ’"
2679,She began to run again .
2680,When I reached the water 's edge I understood her dismay .
2681,Yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them .
2682,She swung lithely down to Dream Baby 's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls .
2683,‘ How bad is the damage ? ’
2684,Ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat .
2685,‘ You 'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders . ’
2686,‘ Who cares ?
2687,"Just cut the damn boat loose , ’ I said vengefully ."
2688,"The man ignored me , walking instead towards Ellen who , dressed only in shorts and T-shirt , was climbing long-legged over Wavebreaker 's rail ."
2689,"Oh , lay me down , just lay me down . ’"
2690,"He kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles , then closed his eyes ."
2691,"And who , dear creature , are you ? ’"
2692,Ellen still said nothing .
2693,"I had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and I could see Sweetman properly , and what I saw I did not like ."
2694,"Thus released , Jesse Sweetman turned to look at me ."
2695,"The dressing gown had proved to be a long , stylish , ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton ."
2696,Beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots .
2697,"‘ You must be Nicholas Breakspear , ’ he said carelessly , as though he did not much care whether I was or not ."
2698,‘ Is that gaudy piece of junk your boat ? ’
2699,I gestured to where Dream Baby 's aerials showed above Wavebreaker 's gunwale .
2700,Sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time .
2701,‘ You look so like your father .
2702,It 's really uncanny . ’
2703,‘ Did you bring that boat here ? ’
2704,"‘ Your mother was Malise Fielding , am I right ?"
2705,Or are you Lucy de Sills ’ son ? ’
2706,"He sighed , intimating what a bore I was being ."
2707,"‘ I did not use fenders , Breakspear , because I despise precautions ."
2708,So tell me the cost of a week 's charter . ’
2709,"‘ The man you want to see , ’ I said , ‘ is called Matthew McIllvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase ."
2710,He did not seem to like what he saw .
2711,‘ How many passengers ? ’
2712,Ellen asked before I could refuse to answer .
2713,"‘ Two , four , six passengers ?"
2714,Does it really matter ? ’
2715,‘ Which are ? ’
2716,Sweetman asked carelessly .
2717,Ellen said flatly .
2718,"‘ You 're talking fuel , food and liquor , plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment , snorkels , jet-skis or sailboards . ’"
2719,"‘ Get off the boat , ’ I said ."
2720,‘ Shut up . ’
2721,"‘ You 're nothing but a hired hand , Breakspear , so shut the fuck up . ’"
2722,He glanced at the paint pot and brush that I was still holding .
2723,‘ Go and paint something .
2724,Be useful . ’
2725,Please be so good as to answer . ’
2726,"‘ Get off this boat , ’ I told him , but my anger only amused Sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart ."
2727,Then I saw why he was so confident .
2728,He put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small .22 pistol that he pointed at my face .
2729,"‘ A ladies ’ gun , ’ he said , ‘ but remarkably effective at close range . ’"
2730,‘ Nick ! ’
2731,"Ellen called warningly , as though I might not have seen the gun ."
2732,"There was , at last , a look of alarm on his face , and I could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger ."
2733,He held the gun pointed at my eyes .
2734,But Shiva and Lili Manjusri saw the picture and so did Rufus Fletcher .
2735,He did not even see an English newspaper .
2736,"He did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the International Herald Tribune , a copy of which Anne found on the beach ."
2737,"‘ Good God , Wyvis Hall , as I live and breathe . ’"
2738,"Beryl Verne-Smith peered , but the picture immediately vanished ."
2739,"‘ Yes , I suppose it was . ’"
2740,"In the background , autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill ."
2741,"‘ Ten and a half , ’ said his wife ."
2742,‘ I shall have to get in touch with the police .
2743,Lewis said nothing .
2744,Suddenly it grew small and poky .
2745,‘ Should n't you wait until Adam gets back ? ’
2746,We can not rid ourselves of it .
2747,They seemed surprised to see him but not astonished .
2748,"mass-produced camera he had used , but quite a good one ."
2749,Adam had asked .
2750,"‘ Rabbits , I expect . ’"
2751,‘ We should pack up now and go . ’
2752,The spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables .
2753,They had packed and Adam had locked up the house .
2754,It was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked .
2755,And now he longed only to get away .
2756,No one asked where he was taking them .
2757,No one spoke .
2758,Adam had Hilbert 's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and Rufus guessed the gun was inside it .
2759,"Adam got down from Goblander and said ,"
2760,"‘ For ever and for ever , farewell , Rufus . ’"
2761,He never had seen any of them again .
2762,"There had been no need to pretend , to turn aside ."
2763,Would they get in touch with him now ?
2764,It was Shiva who had proposed the site .
2765,‘ No reason why you should n't . ’
2766,"‘ My God , ’ she said , putting her coat on , ."
2767,You could n't blame them .
2768,Rufus shook hands .
2769,He closed his eyes .
2770,What worried woman would come to me ?
2771,What Mrs Strawson or Ms Beauchamp ?
2772,What GP would send her to me ?
2773,"If I were innocent , thought Rufus , I know very well what I would do ."
2774,"Bones , skeletons , bodies , do not bury themselves ."
2775,What was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key .
2776,It was defunct .
2777,"Adam sat in his parents ' house , drinking tea ."
2778,"Anne sat next to him on his mother 's cretonne-covered settee and Abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor , kicking with her legs and punching with her arms ."
2779,His mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her .
2780,He had not wanted to come back here .
2781,Anne was furious .
2782,"But he had said nothing , only looked subdued , and Adam realized why ."
2783,Adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an English newspaper while away .
2784,He would have liked very much to be alone .
2785,What was he going to tell Anne ?
2786,How much was he going to tell her ?
2787,He did n't know .
2788,"‘ He had a beard then , Anne . ’"
2789,What a coincidence !
2790,Adam could eat nothing .
2791,"The other time , he remembered , it was his father who had n't been able to eat ."
2792,"‘ Someone from the village , you said , ’ Lewis persisted ."
2793,‘ The police will want to know .
2794,Adam was on his feet at once .
2795,‘ I think we should go . ’
2796,They had to wait until his father was ready .
2797,Adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but Lewis would n't hear of it .
2798,It was possible they might be waiting for him .
2799,They would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of Wyvis Hall .
2800,It was ironical that ten days before he had seen Shiva at Heathrow .
2801,"As soon as they got home , Anne started getting Abigail to bed ."
2802,He could n't look Shiva up because he could n't remember his surname .
2803,She was almost asleep .
2804,"He sat by Abigail 's cot , not wanting to remember , but knowing that now he must ."
2805,There was nothing in his house to remind him of Ecalpemos .
2806,It no longer looked mellow .

3071,They called themselves Die Lucie Geister . ’
3072,‘ Yes . ’

3074,I guess he was one of them ? ’ asked the DDI .

3085,‘ Was there anything else ? ’
3086,There are still many there who have n't forgotten the war .
3087,Some are still waiting for the war to end .

3094,Do n't ratify any names .
3095,‘ We 're not sure .

3097,‘ We hoped you would come up with something . ’
3098,‘ I 'm sure we will . ’
3099,‘ The ones in Russia .
3100,Sorge enjoyed his reply .
3101,But I can tell you you 're wasting your efforts looking for Martin Bormann in South America .
3102,He died twenty years ago . ’
3103,Well and truly shafted .
